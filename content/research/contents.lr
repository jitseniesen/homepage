title: Research Interests
---
body:

* **Numerical analysis** of differential equations, especially
  geometric integration, exponential integrators and spectral methods,
  with application to chemistry, financial mathematics, geophysics and
  plasma physics.
* **Applied dynamical systems**, especially complex networks, pattern
  formation, the stability of travelling waves and Evans function
  computations, and the computing symmetries of differential
  equations.
